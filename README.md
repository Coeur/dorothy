## Setup

### Prerequisites

macOS:

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

Ubuntu / Debian / Kali:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install bash curl
```

Fedora:

```bash
dnf check-update
dnf --refresh --best install bash curl
```

OpenSUSE / SUSE:

```bash
zypper --gpg-auto-import-keys refresh
zypper install bash curl
```

Alpine:

```bash
doas apk update
doas apk add bash curl grep
```

Manjaro:

```bash
pamac install bash curl
```

Arch:

```bash
pacman-key --init
pacman --refresh --sync --needed bash curl
```

Void:

```bash
xbps-install --sync --update xbps
xbps-install --sync bash curl
```

Mageia, Nix, and Gentoo are [currently unsupported.](https://github.com/bevry/dorothy/issues/162)

### Try

If you just want to trial [Dorothy commands](https://github.com/bevry/dorothy/tree/master/commands) without configuring your shell, you can do the following:

```bash
# To run only a specific command, run the following and swap out `echo-verbose` with whatever command you wish to run
bash -ic "$(curl -fsSL https://dorothy.bevry.me/commands/echo-verbose)" -- a b c

# To run multiple commands in a REPL, run the following then type the commands you wish to execute
eval "$(curl -fsSL https://dorothy.bevry.me/try)"
```

### Install

To install Dorothy run the following in your favorite terminal application:

```bash
# Run the Dorothy installation script
bash -ilc "$(curl -fsSL https://dorothy.bevry.me/install)"
```

During installation, Dorothy will ask you to create a repository to store your user configuration, such as a `dotfiles` repository. If you already have a dotfiles repository, you can use that, or make another.

Verify the installation worked by selecting a theme for Dorothy by running:

```bash
# you must open a new terminal instance first
dorothy theme
# then open a new terminal
```

To select your login shell, run `select-shell`.

## Troubleshooting

If your shell doesn't recognize the syntax, run `bash -il` then run the command again.

If you get a command not found error or an undefined/unbound variable error, [verify that your terminal application has login shells enabled.](https://github.com/bevry/dorothy/blob/master/docs/dorothy/dorothy-not-loading.md) If you are running in a login shell, then you may be running in an unsupported shell, run `bash -il` to open bash, if it still doesn't work, then run the installer again, and make sure to confirm the setup for Dorothy for each shell when prompted.

If packages are failing to install, [go back to the "Prerequisites" section](https://github.com/bevry/dorothy#prerequisites).

## Overview

### Dorothy Core

Dorothy installs itself to `$DOROTHY`, which defaults to the [XDG](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/XDG_Base_Directory) location of `~/.local/share/dorothy`, and consists of the following:

-   [`commands` directory](https://github.com/bevry/dorothy/tree/master/commands) contains executable commands of super-stable quality, they are actively used within the Dorothy core and by the users of Dorothy.
-   [`commands.beta` directory](https://github.com/bevry/dorothy/tree/master/commands.beta) contains executable commands of beta quality, these are commands that require more usage or possible breaking changes before promotion to `commands`.
-   [`config` directory](https://github.com/bevry/dorothy/tree/master/config) contains default configuration
-   [`sources` directory](https://github.com/bevry/dorothy/tree/master/sources) contains scripts that are loaded into the shell environment
-   [`themes` directory](https://github.com/bevry/dorothy/tree/master/themes) contains themes that you can select via the `DOROTHY_THEME` environment variable
-   [`user` directory](https://github.com/balupton/dotfiles) is your own github repository for your custom configuration

For each shell that you configured during the Dorothy installation (can be reconfigured via the `dorothy install` command), the configured shell performs the following steps when you open a new shell instance via your terminal:

1.  The shell loads Dorothy's initialization script:

    -   [Fish](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish_(Unix_shell)>) loads our [`init.fish`](https://github.com/bevry/dorothy/blob/master/init.fish) script
    -   [Nushell](https://www.nushell.sh) loads our [`init.nu`](https://github.com/bevry/dorothy/blob/master/init.nu) script
    -   POSIX shells ([bash](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)>), [zsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell), etc) load our [`init.sh`](https://github.com/bevry/dorothy/blob/master/init.sh) script

1.  The initialization script will:

    1. Ensure the `DOROTHY` environment variable is set to the location of the Dorothy installation.

    1. If a login shell, it loads our login script `sources/login.(sh|fish|nu)`, which will:

        1. Apply any configuration changes necessary for that login shell
        1. Load our environment script `sources/environment.(sh|fish|nu)`, which will:

            1. Invoke `commands/setup-environment-commands` which determines and applies all necessary environment configuration changes to the shell. It loads your `user/config(.local)/environment.bash` configuration script for your own custom environment configuration that will be applied to all your login shells.

    1. If a login and interactive shell, it loads our interactive script `sources/interactive.(sh|fish|nu)`, which will:

        1. Load your own `user/config(.local)/interactive.(sh|fish|nu)` configuration script for your own interactive login shell configuration.
            - Nushell will only load `interactive.nu` and it must exist.
            - Fish shell will load `interactive.fish` if it exists, otherwise it will load `interactive.sh`.
            - POSIX shells will load their `interactive.(bash|zsh|...etc)` file if it exists, otherwise they will load `interactive.sh` if exists.
        1. Load any common alias and function utilities.
        1. Load our theme configuration.
        1. Load our ssh configuration.
        1. Load our autocomplete configuration.

This is the foundation enables Dorothy's hundreds of commands, to work across hundreds of machines, across dozens of operating system and shell combinations, seamlessly.

### Dorothy User Configuration

Your user configuration goes to the XDG location of `~/.local/config/dorothy` which Dorothy symlinks to `~/.local/share/dorothy/user`, your user configuration consists of the following:

-   `commands` directory, for public commands
-   `commands.local` directory, for private commands (git ignored by default)
-   `config` directory, for public configuration
-   `config.local` directory, for private configuration (git ignored by default)

The order of preference within Dorothy is `(commands|config).local` first, then `(commands|config)`, then Dorothy's own `(commands|config)` then everything else.

You can find the various configuration files that are available to you by browsing Dorothy's default [`config` directory](https://github.com/bevry/dorothy/tree/master/config).
